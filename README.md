### The Origin Story

You're an athlete. Your goal is to optimize your pitch. You're training 24/7 and need the go-anywhere-tools to practice pitching while your on the go. Good thing you'd never leave home without your phone!

HighHeat is a mobile application for training world-class pitchers. With your phone held firmly in your hand, practice your pitch and see your results. HighHeat will report back on your pitch speed, providing you the feedback needed for maximum improvement.
